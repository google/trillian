TOKEN BUCKET
===================

Script to read and update a token bucket maintained in Redis. This is an
implementation of the token bucket algorithm which is a common fixture seen in
rate limiting:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket

For each key prefix, we maintain three values:

    * `<prefix>.tokens`: Number of tokens in bucket at refresh time.

    * `<prefix>.refreshed`: Time in epoch seconds when this prefix's bucket was
      last updated.

    * `<prefix>.refreshed_us`: The microsecond component of the last updated
      time above. Stored separately because a Unix epoch with a microsecond
      component brushes up uncomfortably close to integer boundaries.

The basic strategy is to, at update/read time, fill in all tokens
that would have accumulated since the last update, and then if
possible deduct the number of requested tokens (or disallow the
requested action if there are not enough tokens).

The approach relies on the atomicity of EVAL in redis - only 1 command (EVAL or
otherwise) will be running concurrently per shard in the Redis cluster. Redis
and Lua are very fast, so in practice this works out okay.

A note on units: all times (instants) are measured in epoch seconds with a
separate microsecond component, durations in imicroseconds, and rates in
tokens/second (e.g., a rate of 100 is 100 tokens/second).

For debugging, I'd recommend adding Redis log statements and then tailing your
Redis log. Example:

    redis.log(redis.LOG_WARNING, string.format("rate = %s", rate))
