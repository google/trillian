# The Claimant Model: Index

The Claimant Model describes the set of relationships involved where *trust* is a factor.

1. [Claimant Model](CoreModel.md): The core Claimant Model forms the foundation for the other documents
2. [Claimant Model: Logs](Logs.md): Verifiable Log Transparency, described using the Claimant Model
