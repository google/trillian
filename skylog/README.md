# Skylog

Skylog stands for *scalable log*. This is the new experimental design for
Trillian logs that supports horizontal scaling: it achieves higher throughput by
using distributed storage and keeping the write path parallel. It does so with a
relatively low latency, which makes the system nearly real-time.

It is not for production use yet.

*TODO(pavelkalinnikov): Keep writing, add design docs.*
